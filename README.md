## Abstract 

This project is the first project completed for Machine Learning and Data Mining course during my senior year at the University of Toronto. In this project, my fellow teammate, Yuan Yao, and me explored the effectiveness of applying linear regression on classfications problems of two different actors, two different genders and the overfitting problems. We also visualized the final weights used on the feature vectors.
